# Releases

release-please keeps one release PR open on `main`. The `release-cadence`
workflow (`scripts/ci/release-cadence.ts`) arms it with auto-merge once its
checks are green and the merge queue holds nothing but release PRs, or once it
has been green for 30 minutes. The merge publishes `@open-bus/cli` to npm and
upgrades prod from CI (`deploy-prod`, then `verify-release`).

## Holding a release

To keep a release from shipping, such as while a fix for a just-merged bug is
still in review, put the `release-hold` label on the release PR:

    gh pr edit <release PR> --add-label release-hold

While the label is on:

- `plan` does not arm the PR.
- `arm` re-reads the labels right before it enqueues, so a hold set during a
  run still wins.
- If the cadence already armed the PR and it is not yet in the queue, the next
  run disables auto-merge. It never touches an arm a person set.
- Once the PR is in the merge queue, the label no longer stops it. Remove it
  from the queue in GitHub instead.

Remove the label to release. The next cadence run (every 15 minutes, or after
CI) arms the PR as usual:

    gh pr edit <release PR> --remove-label release-hold

A held release PR that stays open for over 24 hours still gets a `blocker`
issue, as a reminder that the hold is on.

## Card keys

The agent card (spec `2026-10-29-agent-card-design.md`) uses three Worker
secrets. Setup adds them to any Worker that lacks them: on install, on a
plain rerun, and on the CI upgrade, which preflight allows.

- **`CARD_SIGNING_KEY`** is the Ed25519 private key that signs cards and link
  assertions. Its `kid` (`ob-<UTC time>-<hex>`) records when it was made.
- **`CARD_SIGNING_KEY_PREV`** is the previous key's public half, so cards
  signed before a rotation still verify until they expire.
- **`CARD_OWNER_SALT`** derives the owner id every linked app sees. It is
  never rotated, because a new salt would break every link. The id is
  `base64url(HMAC-SHA256(key, "owner\n" + aud))`, where `key` is the UTF-8
  bytes of the salt string exactly as stored, not its base64url-decoded bytes.
  The id is fixed once the first app links, so neither the salt nor the
  derivation may change.

To rotate the key (it leaked, say), run this from the repo:

    pnpm -s ob:setup --name <instance> --rotate-card-key

- Setup reads the current key back from `https://<host>/.well-known/jwks.json`
  and puts it as `_PREV` alongside the new key. If it can't read the JWKS,
  nothing changes.
- It refuses to run within 24 hours of the last rotation, because the previous
  key must stay published that long. `--force` overrides this, and cards signed
  with the key being dropped stop verifying.
- A bus deployed with the shared test key refuses requests, and its `/healthz`
  reports `problem: test_card_key`. `--rotate-card-key --force` then puts a new
  key and does not keep the test key, because the test key is public. It also
  deletes any `CARD_SIGNING_KEY_PREV`, because the Worker refuses a test key
  there too.

`--rotate-card-key` never runs under `--check`, `--ci` or `--destroy`.

# Codex probe (C26), 2026-10-29

Can OpenBus support Codex, both the CLI and the desktop app? Four questions:
MCP, attestation, wake, kind. macOS arm64.

## Versions

- CLI: `@openai/codex` 0.165.0 (npm latest), installed into a scratch prefix
  and run by full path.
- Desktop app: `ChatGPT.app` (bundle id `com.openai.codex`, 26.917.51856). It
  is Electron and bundles its own `codex` binary (`codex-cli 0.155.0-alpha.16`)
  in `Contents/Resources/`.

## Method

- Every Codex run used a temp `CODEX_HOME`. The real `~/.codex` was only
  read: names, mtimes, field names, and `sqlite3 ... ?immutable=1`. Nothing
  under it changed during the probe, and `auth.json` was never opened.
- No credentials, no network. A temp `config.toml` set
  `[model_providers.stub]` (`wire_api = "responses"`,
  `requires_openai_auth = false`). It pointed at a scripted OpenAI Responses
  stub on 127.0.0.1. The stub calls the probe MCP tool when the prompt says
  `start`, calls `exec_command` when it says `shellprobe`, and otherwise
  answers with text.
- Probe MCP server: about 50 lines of node over stdio. It logs its argv, env
  keys, ppid and ancestor chain, and every message it receives. After a tool
  call it pushes `notifications/message`, `notifications/claude/channel`,
  `tools/list_changed` and a `sampling/createMessage` request.
- Harnesses driven:
  - `codex exec`.
  - The TUI, in a pty.
  - The shared app-server daemon (`codex app-server daemon start`), through a
    websocket client on its control socket.
  - A private stdio `codex app-server`, which is how the desktop app runs Codex.
- The desktop app was never launched. Evidence for it comes from static
  inspection of `app.asar` (its main-process JS), the bundled binary's
  `strings`, and the real `~/.codex`.
- All processes were mine and were stopped by pid.

## 1. MCP

**Loads.** `[mcp_servers.probe]` in `config.toml` (command, args, env) is
spawned and initialised:

- `clientInfo` is `codex-mcp-client` 0.165.0, protocol `2025-06-18`.
- The client capabilities are `elicitation` and experimental
  `codex/auth-change`; there is no sampling.
- Tools reach the model as a namespace `mcp__probe` holding `whoami`.
- By default a tool call is refused under `approval_policy = "never"` ("MCP
  tool call requires approval"). Our entry needs
  `default_tools_approval_mode = "approve"`.

**Env is filtered.** The server gets only `HOME LANG LOGNAME PATH SHELL TERM
TMPDIR USER __CF_USER_TEXT_ENCODING`, plus the `env` table from its entry.
There is no `CODEX_*` var, so not even `CODEX_HOME`. `env_vars = [...]` can pass
named vars through.

**Session identity arrives per call, not at spawn.** Every `tools/call` carries
`_meta`:

- Keys: `callId`, `itemId`, `progressToken`, `sessionId`, `threadId`,
  `windowId`, and `x-codex-turn-metadata`.
- `x-codex-turn-metadata` holds `session_id`, `thread_id`, `turn_id`,
  `thread_source` (`user`), `turn_trigger` (`exec`), `sandbox`,
  `workspaces` (an object keyed by root path) and `codex_version`. There is
  no `cwd` key.
- `initialize` carries no session.

**One MCP process per thread.** Two threads in one daemon spawned two probe
servers.

**Parent process:**

| Harness | MCP server's parent |
|---|---|
| `codex exec`, `--no-daemon` | the `codex` process itself |
| TUI | the shared daemon `codex app-server --listen unix:// --managed-daemon`; the TUI starts it if it is down |
| desktop app | the app's own `codex app-server` (bundled binary, stdio child of the Electron main process) |

The desktop row comes from static evidence only. The app spawns its bundled
`codex app-server` over stdio. It uses the shared daemon only when
`CODEX_APP_SERVER_USE_LOCAL_DAEMON=1` is set.

**The app reads the same `~/.codex`:**

- Its JS resolves `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}`.
- The real `config.toml` has a `[desktop]` table that the app writes
  (`followUpQueueMode` and others), next to the user's `mcp_servers`. The app
  builds its MCP config from that file (`buildMcpCodexConfig`).
- `state_5.sqlite` `threads` holds rows with `originator = "Codex Desktop"`
  (source `vscode`), and their rollouts are under `~/.codex/sessions`.

So one `[mcp_servers.openbus]` entry reaches the CLI, the TUI and the app.

## 2. Attestation

**Codex's on-disk state:**

- Rollouts are at `sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<ts>-<thread uuid>.jsonl`. The
  first line is `session_meta`, with keys `id session_id cwd originator source
  thread_source cli_version model_provider git timestamp ...`.
- `session_index.jsonl` has the keys `id`, `thread_name` and `updated_at`.
- `state_5.sqlite` `threads` has columns including `id`, `rollout_path`,
  `source`, `originator`, `cwd`, `archived` and `agent_path`. Subagent threads
  have a JSON `source` of `{"subagent":{"thread_spawn":{"parent_thread_id":...}}}`.
- `thread-writer-locks/<thread>.lock` is an empty file that the process
  hosting the thread holds open (flock). `lsof -t` on it returned exactly the
  `codex` process that is the probe MCP's parent: the exec process, or the
  daemon pid for all three daemon threads. The same process also holds the
  rollout open.

**A Codex shell command is a sibling of the MCP server.** `exec_command`
runs `/bin/zsh -c` as a direct child of the same `codex` process. The shell
gets `CODEX_THREAD_ID`, `CODEX_SESSION_ID` and `CODEX_TOOL_CALL_ID`; the MCP
server gets none of them.

**Proposed check.** The adapter defers its hello until its first `tools/call`,
then sends `{thread_id, call_id, pid}` from `_meta`. The daemon accepts only
when all of the following hold:

1. The adapter's parent P has a `codex` comm, and its start time matches the
   one recorded at hello. This is the pid-reuse guard, as for Pi and omp.
2. P holds `<codex home>/thread-writer-locks/<thread_id>.lock` (`lsof -t`; on
   Linux, `/proc/locks`).
3. That thread's rollout, which P holds open, contains an unanswered
   `function_call` with this `call_id` in the `mcp__openbus` namespace.
   Codex writes it before calling the tool: this was observed at call time.
   Only that thread's model can create the entry.
4. The thread is not a subagent: `thread_source` in `_meta` is `user`, and
   `state_5` `source` is not `{"subagent":...}`. This is the omp-style guard.

**How it can fail:**

- A process that is not P's child fails step 1. A replayed old `call_id`
  fails step 3.
- A shell in thread A of the same daemon or app cannot claim thread B without
  step 3. With step 3, it could only race an in-flight openbus call in B, and
  B's own adapter would then collide on the same ref.
- Without step 3, the multi-thread daemon and the app fall below Claude's bar:
  ppid plus lock alone lets any sibling thread claim any other.
- `lsof` costs about 50 to 100 ms. Do it once per hello, not per frame.
- The codex home must be known. The MCP env has no `CODEX_HOME`, so put it in
  the entry's `env`, or the daemon resolves `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}`.
- Liveness: the daemon keeps a thread loaded (lock held) after the TUI exits.
  So "lock held" means "Codex has it loaded", not "a user is watching".

**Live capture (C26c), 2026-10-29.** `codex exec` 0.165.0, a temp
`CODEX_HOME`, the stub model calling `send_message` in namespace
`mcp__openbus`, and a stand-in server under `[mcp_servers.openbus]` that
copied the rollout the instant `tools/call` arrived. Redacted (cwd, base
instructions) and abridged (messages, token counts):

```jsonl
{"timestamp":"2026-10-29T01:11:43.878Z","ordinal":9,"type":"response_item","payload":{"type":"function_call","id":"fc_1","name":"send_message","namespace":"mcp__openbus","arguments":"{\"to\":\"peer\",\"text\":\"hi\"}","call_id":"call_1","internal_chat_message_metadata_passthrough":{"turn_id":"01a18536-7fa0-…"}},"metadata":{"client_authored":false,"user_input_order":1}}
{"timestamp":"2026-10-29T01:11:44.519Z","ordinal":11,"type":"event_msg","payload":{"type":"item_completed","thread_id":"01a18536-7f07-…","turn_id":"…","item":{"type":"McpToolCall","id":"call_1","server":"openbus","tool":"send_message","arguments":{"to":"peer","text":"hi"},"status":"completed","result":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"sent"}]},…}}}
{"timestamp":"2026-10-29T01:11:44.521Z","ordinal":12,"type":"response_item","payload":{"type":"function_call_output","id":"fco_…","call_id":"call_1","output":[{"type":"input_text","text":"Wall time: 0.6365 seconds\nOutput:"},{"type":"input_text","text":"sent"}],…},"metadata":{…,"mcp_attribution":{"status":"complete","sources":[{"server_name":"openbus","tool_name":"send_message",…}]}}}
```

- **Flushed before the call.** The copy taken at `tools/call` already held the
  `function_call` line, complete and newline-terminated, and nothing for
  `call_1` after it. The daemon still reads once more after 50 ms when a call
  is absent.
- **The namespace is the entry name.** `mcp__openbus` comes from the table
  name, so the installer (C26e) must write exactly `[mcp_servers.openbus]`.
- **A call closes twice:** `item_completed` (with `item.id` = the call id)
  and then `function_call_output`. The daemon treats either as answered.
- `lsof -t` on the lock returned the MCP server's parent, the native `codex`
  binary (`…/codex-darwin-arm64/vendor/aarch64-apple-darwin/bin/codex`), not
  the npm `codex` node shim above it.
- **macOS proves "open", not "locked".** `lsof -t` lists every process with
  the lock file open, whether or not it holds the flock. A same-user process
  whose executable is named `codex` can open `<thread>.lock` read-only and pass
  check 2 for any thread; only check 3 (a call id still open in its own
  turn, written after the process started, and never admitted
  before) stands in its way. Linux reads `/proc/locks`, so there the lock
  itself is checked.
- `state_5` `source` was the plain string `exec`. The fixture
  (`packages/daemon/test/fixtures/codex-rollout-*.jsonl`) is this capture.

**What the bar assumes.** All four checks read files under `CODEX_HOME`, so
they hold only while nothing but Codex writes there. A same-user process that
can write to `CODEX_HOME` can append a `function_call` to any rollout, point
`rollout_path` in `state_5` elsewhere, or replace a lock file. The daemon
refuses a symlinked lock or rollout, but cannot tell a forged line from a
real one. Codex's sandbox should keep `CODEX_HOME` out of the model's
writable roots under `read-only` and `workspace-write` (not verified here);
under `danger-full-access` (or `--yolo`) nothing does, and there the attestation is only as strong as
the user's trust in that thread. The other harnesses have the same same-user
limit: the daemon has no peer credentials, so `hello.pid` is a claim, which
is why a codex connection is bound to its one call.

## 3. Wake

**`codex queue --thread <id> --message <text>` wakes an idle thread.** It
writes `queue_1.sqlite` (`queued_items`; a trigger bumps
`queued_thread_revisions`). The process hosting the thread sees the change
(`thread/queue/changed`) and starts a turn with that text as the user message.
Observed:

| Host | Idle thread, after `codex queue` |
|---|---|
| shared daemon (the TUI's host) | turn started within 1 s; the stub got the queued text |
| TUI attached to the daemon | same; the TUI rendered the turn and its reply |
| private stdio app-server, no daemon running (how the app runs) | turn started; the stub got the text |
| `codex exec`, after exit | stored in `queue_1.sqlite`, no turn: delivered on the next resume |

So:

- **TUI:** a real wake, like Claude channels.
- **exec:** no wake. It is one-shot, so a message waits for a resume.
- **App:** a wake is expected, because its bundled 0.155 alpha binary has
  `codex queue`, `queued_thread_revisions` and `thread/queue/changed`. This was
  not observed live, since the app was not launched. The app's
  `followUpQueueMode` (`queue`, `steer` or `send-now`) governs only prompts
  typed during a running turn.

The daemon transport would shell out to the user's own `codex queue` (or write
`queue_1.sqlite` the same way). A message sent mid-turn waits for the turn to
end.

**Ruled out:**

- MCP pushes. `notifications/claude/channel` and `notifications/message` are
  ignored, and `sampling/createMessage` returns -32601.
- `thread/inject_items` adds items without starting a turn.
- `notify` runs only after a turn completes.
- Hooks (`SessionStart`, `Stop` and others) run only inside a turn.
- App-server `turn/start` from a second client on the daemon socket does wake
  the thread, but the app's private stdio app-server has no socket. `codex
  queue` covers both.
- The app's own IPC bus (`~/.codex/ipc/ipc.sock`, with
  `thread-follower-start-turn` and similar messages) is private and
  undocumented. It was not used.

**C26d check (2026-10-29, CLI 0.165.0, temp `CODEX_HOME`, stub model).** A
first cut of the daemon's `CodexTransport` ran `codex queue` for a thread made
by `codex exec`, with a hostile body. (The shipped transport runs `codex
queue` only for a live thread whose host wakes; an exec or closed thread gets
no `codex queue` and keeps the offline semantics, so no receipt says less
than what Codex will do.)

- One row in `queued_items`, text exactly as sent: the `[openbus] Message
  from peer to you (cx). … (msg_id mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm1)` header, the body's
  `$(touch …)` and backticks literal (no file created), and a forged
  `[openbus]` body line escaped as `\[openbus]`. A second delivery of the
  same msg_id ran nothing (the daemon's `codex-queued.json`).
- `codex exec resume <thread> "second prompt"` started a turn with the queued
  text first: the stub's request carried it as a user message, before the new
  prompt; `queued_items` was then empty.
- `--message -` is taken literally (a turn with the text `-`): `codex queue`
  has no stdin or file input, so the text goes in argv. **Other local users
  can see the message text in `ps` for the queue command's lifetime** (a
  fraction of a second; at most its 10 s timeout). **Accepted by the user
  (2026-10-29)**: the only alternative is writing Codex's `queue_1.sqlite`
  directly, which D2 ruled out.
- `--thread=<ref>` and `--message=<text>` keep a value that starts with `-`
  a value: `--thread=--help` is looked up as a thread, and
  `--message=--help\n…` was queued verbatim.
- Not re-run here: the wake of a live host (§3's table covers it) and an
  end-to-end send through the real daemon from a second agent.

## 4. Kind

Readers have been kind-agnostic since 0.45.0: `KindTokenSchema` and
`displayKind` turn an unknown kind into `other`. So `codex` needs no new
version constant:

- The hub already hides any kind outside `PRE_TOKEN_KINDS` from daemons below
  `KIND_TOKEN_MIN_CLIENT` (the SQL filter).
- For adapters without the IPC marker, the daemon already rewrites any unknown
  kind to `pi` (`legacyKind`, C23c).
- What does change: `AGENT_KINDS` gains `codex` (the writer enum for `hello`
  and `agent_up`), and the daemon's fallback for an old hub that answers
  `agent_up` with `bad_frame` must cover codex too. Today that fallback is
  `ompAsPi` and is hard-wired to omp.

**Recommendation:**

- Old daemons: hidden, as today, through the hub filter. Their closed enum
  cannot hold `other`.
- Old adapters: show `codex` as `pi`, the existing `legacyKind`. The row stays
  addressable by name, which was C23c's reason. Hiding it would make a Codex
  agent unreachable from old sessions, and `other` is not in their enum. `pi`
  is a wrong label for Codex: it is the nearest kind only by default, not by
  lineage. The doc comment on `legacyKind` should say so.
- Old hubs: generalize `ompAsPi` to any kind the hub refuses, so codex
  registers as `pi` there.

## Open decisions (user)

1. **Attestation strength.** Ship with check 3 (rollout `call_id`), or accept
   ppid plus lock only? Without check 3, in the daemon and the app, one thread
   can claim another.
2. **Wake via `codex queue`.** OpenBus would invoke the user's installed
   `codex` binary, or write `~/.codex/queue_1.sqlite` directly. Both depend on
   an experimental, unversioned interface.
3. **Approval.** Is it acceptable for our installer to set
   `default_tools_approval_mode = "approve"` on the openbus entry? Without it,
   every bus tool call prompts, and calls fail under `never`.
4. **Desktop app.** Accept the static evidence, or have the user run the app
   once with the openbus entry so we can confirm the parent process and the
   queue wake live?
5. **Label for old adapters:** `pi`, or hide `codex` from them?
